# dc.js
This is my G.P. repository for my dc.js / crossfilter personal learning path. In here, I'll be storing small examples of web pages with dashboards. Other than utter uselessness and tacky design, you won't find much.

You're welcome to reuse these snippets. Should you find yourself as the target of aggressive criticism, social abandon or even attemps on your life due to using these, please credit them to me. If, on the other hand, you find any usefulness in these, your work leaps forward and you get that well deserved and much awaited promotion, you might decide to:
* claim it as your own (and pray that no one else finds this);
* include a comment in your code (keeps your conscience clean while still not publicly crediting me);
* credit me in your page;
* make a donation (to me, of course!)
* make a donation, build a public shrine, offer me a kidney for transplant...
  1. not needed
  2. please don't
  3. my kidneys are great, but thanks anyway

Each folder will, to the best of my capacity, be a self contained pod, with all the necessary code and either the data files or links to retreive them, typically in Github. By _necessary_ I don't mean JavaScript libraries, of course. I typically download them, in order to allow me to still work offline / on the road. I'll try and keep a commented CDN / original rep link, but no promises.
